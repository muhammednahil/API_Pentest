     
• xss attack occure where its possible to inject malicious script into application which is then viewed by victim, genrelly in the form of browser side.  
  
  
• Reflected and stored xss  
  
•login/registration  
  
  
• Stored XSS -  
	◇For example Comments section , add our xss payload(<script>alert('hacked')</script>) in between our comment upload it , try to call that comment using comment_id see it show any alert msg.  
	◇if the content-type is application/json convert to text/html .  
	◇ same goes for xml but use html encoding. (html entity encode).  
  
• Reflected XXS -  
	◇ for Example get user section, add our xss payload (<script>alert('hacked')</script>) do url encode to our payload.  
	◇ simply add any url parameter, like as="payload"  
  
  
• Content-type xss -  
	◇ this xss vulnerability exist in login API.    
	◇ for example some time we try to login with already exsiting suername it give the msg like "already a user" , so try our payload in the username field and try to create same account again (username=samepalyload) it give the msg like “user ‘payload’ already exists" without encodeing the html characters.  
  
  
• xss Reflected in users API endpoint -  
	◇ the endpoint which give the user information.  
	◇ try out url encode payload as an endpoint in the url ([http://example.com/api/users/payload](http://example.com/api/users/payload)[)](http://example.com/api/users/payload)) and try non existing http method like PATCH , so it may output the payload without any encoding .
