 
• this attack exploit the fact the most regular expression implemmentation may reach extreme situatuion that cause them to work very slowly (exponentialy related to input size).  
  
• An attacker can cause a programme using a regular expression enter these extreme situation and then hang for very long time .  
  
• (\w+\d)+c  
◇ \w+ :- match any word character(a-z,A-Z,0-9)  
◇ \d+ :- match a digit (0-9)  
◇ c :- case sensitive (end at c)  
  
asff1234c (valid)  
!!!!c (not valid)  
  
• for example, email_id validation regex used will be [A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}  
it will take time to process if we give longest input, so this could lead to DoS.

	“email_id": “aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!”
