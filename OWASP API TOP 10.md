## 1. Broken object level Authorization
- create two account, user1 and user2
- capture the request  
	eg:- api.example.com/user/"user1"/delete
- You have the permission to delete your account, what about someone else.  
eg:- api.example.com/user/"user2"/delete
- if its sucess its called Broken object level authorization.
 
 ---
 
 ## 2. Broken Authentication
 
 - Authentication mechanism for clients and end-users are sometimes not properly specified and implemented.
 - Attackers can use that flawed implementation to compromise authentication token and assume the identify of other user.
 - check for :-
	- sensitive data(token in url, etc..)  
	- doesn't validate token  
	- no account lockout  
	- weak password (1234)  
	- no bruteforce protection  
	- accept (unsigned token or jwt none attack)  
	- use of plaint text, weekly hashing password, base64 password, weak encryption keys/ API keys. 
	
	---
	
	## 3. Excessive Data Exposure
	
	-  Does your API call return either sensitive data by design or full data object stored in DB.
	- if returned content filtered on the client side before presented to the user.
		- if yes,  you stand a string chance of being vulnerable.
	
	---
	
	## 4. Lack of Resource and Rate limiting
	
- attacker overload api by sending more request it can handle.  
- attacker send request at a rate exceeding the APIs processing speed, cloggit it up  
- the size of request or some field in them exceed, what the APIs can process.  
- zip bombs archive file that have been design so that unpackaging them takes excessive amount of resource overload API
---

## 5. Broken Function level Autherization

- can a regular user acess admin endpoints?
- can a user perform sensitive action
-    can a user from group X access a function that should expose only to users from group Y by simply guesing the endpoint URL and parameters.
---

## 6. Mass Assignment

- check for :-
	-    permision related property(user_admin, user_vip)
	-    process dependent property(user_cash - payment verification)
	-   internal property

---

## 7. Security Misconfiguration

- check for :-
	-    cors / HTTPVERB / error
	-   unpatched system
	-    common endpoint  
	- unprotected file & directory.  
	- unhardened images.  
	- miconfigured TLS or outdated.  
	- exposed storage or sever managment panel.  
	- missing security header  
	- unnecessary features enabled.
	---
## 8. Injection
-    try back slash(\) to check for error and check if its vulernable or not.
-   where to look(parameter, headers, forms)
-    change the paramater value to your query.
---
## 9. Improper assets managment
- documentation not updated.
-    no retirment plan for each api version.
-    host inventary is missing or outdated.
-    old or previous api vesion are runnning unpatched.
---
## 10. Insuffcient Logging and Monitoring
-    improper validation
-   potential leaks
-  Logs are not protected for integrity.
- Logs are not integrated into Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems.
