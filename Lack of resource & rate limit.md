• try delete comment/delete same as above method  
  
• this attack will lead to DoS.  
  
  
• for example a request /api/users/?page=1&result=100 , in this case displays to 100 users, what if i change paramter to api/users/?page=1&result=100000000000000000000, it could cause the perfomance of backend database since size paramter is large & it became unresponsive and unable to handle further request. so this called lack of resources.
