     
• this vulnerabiity occur when a user is able to intialize or overwite serverside variables for which are not intended by the application.  
  
  
• for example a malicious user want to bypass email verify, try to add the email-verfiy=True parameter, if your able bypass it its called Mass Assignment vulnerability  
  
• for example developer should not include nested object, try to abuse the paramter like  
	{  
	email: ["email1","email2","email3"]  
	}  
if your able bypass it its called Mass Assignment vulnerability  
  
• for example there's a PUT request & there's a API where trying to call /api/videos/xyz , request has parameter  
	name = myvideo  
	fromat = mp4  
  
we will try crafted request , so try to call get request GET /api/myvideos/xyz, in this response you may get all the object properties name,  
	vid  
	file_name  
	conversion_name  
  
 •  this way we get object properties so we can craft malicious call to hiden vulnerability.  add conversion parameter in the reqest and the value place try for cmd injection payload.  
  
  
• for example reset password scenario, there will be email, old password , new pasword paramters , try to remove new_password parameter from the request, if it bypass its called Mass assignment vulnerability.  
  
• for example user signup scenario, try to add admin=True in the request ,if its bypass its called Mass assignment vulnerability.
