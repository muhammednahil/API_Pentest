• if its vulerable the content may execute in the backend.  
	◇ now you can try payload in our content field. like  
#hello  
!!python/object/apply:subprocess.check_output[ !!str “ls”, ]  
  
the above payload will list the files in thier current directory files  
  
try some sensitive file to read like /etc/passwd  
  
  
◇ check the file extenstion that you upload(ymal )
